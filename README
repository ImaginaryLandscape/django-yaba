Title:
django_yaba, aka, django-yet-another-blog-application

I know, we didn't have enough blog engines built with Django right? Hell, finding a name for this one was a PITA thanks to all the others ones that exists. Hence, YABA it is. If anyone else already has this, and I just missed it, let me know, and I'll change the name of this one. 

Purpose:
I tend to blog a bit (http://www.f4ntasmic.com), and have built my own blog previously using Django. I wanted something a bit more flexible though, so I decided to build it with the idea of being able to plug it anywhere with minimal configuration. I'm going to leverage YAML (http://www.yaml.de/en/) for the theme of the blog, so that you can have a fairly pretty blog out of the box within minutes. Anyways, let me know if you have any questions.

Features:

   Using http://www.wymeditor.org/. Thanks to http://jannisleidel.com/2008/11/autocomplete-widget-for-django-tagging-form-fields.
   Works

Blog Posts:
   Will allow previews for authenticated users eventually. Backburner.

   Sorta works now. No links to it currently.

BlogRoll:
   Quite functional. One would hope right? They're flipping links.

Articles:
    The articles are items that won't show up in the traditional main news feed. Also, if you check the "Buttoned" box, then the article will have a link to it on the top main nav bar. Currently functional

    Currently in place and work. Would like to add CAPTCHA though.

    Currently can grab your latest tweets, GitHub commits, and builds links to submit stories to Digg, Reddit, Delicious, and StumbleUpon. Github/Twitter configurable via simple settings in settings.py
